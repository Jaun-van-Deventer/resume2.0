                Hi there, and welcome to my profile. <br /> <br />
                My name is <strong>Jaun</strong> and I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for building impactful applications and a solid background in both front-end and back-end technologies. My skill set spans a variety of languages and frameworks, including <strong> JavaScript, C#, Python, Node.js, React, PHP, and SQL</strong>. I enjoy creating intuitive, responsive front-end experiences with <strong>Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML5,</strong> while also building efficient back-end systems using <strong>MongoDB and Node.</strong> <br /><br />
                Most of my current projects, including this website, are hosted on GitHub, showcasing my commitment to clean, maintainable code and open-source collaboration. Iâ€™m always looking to expand my knowledge, tackle challenging projects, and contribute to meaningful solutions in tech. You can view some of my projects from the Projects page, however that's only a few of them a lot of the others are not deployed yet or won't be deployed.
